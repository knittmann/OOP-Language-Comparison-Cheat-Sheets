# OOP-Language-Comparison-Cheat-Sheets
If you know one OOP language then you can usually switch easily between them with minimal learning. However, with all of their small variations, remembering details such as which language uses strict comparison (===) or which language wants boolean values to be capitalized or not (TRUE/FALSE vs true/false) can get a little confusing (at least it can for me). That is what this wiki aims to help with.
